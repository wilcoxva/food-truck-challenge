### food-truck-challenge
San Francisco's Food Truck Marketing App

This was a fun and interesting challenge!

I chose to do a Marketing page showcasing each of the different trucks. Each with a View More button included, to allow a user to view more details about each of the trucks.

For the git process, some things I would do differently would be wait for feedback to implement and approvals to merge changes. I would also delete branches after merging to main (I wanted to keep them around in case you wanted to review them). I would also include many more meaningful commits in each of my branches (there wasn't much work for me to separate in each branch, as I was mostly breaking small features into multiple branches).

As far as the code goes, I would use a CSS file instead of inline styles. I would also create more detail for each of the trucks and would have liked to use images. Also, I would take advantage of creating an app token and use an environment variable to add that to the project.

In order to run this, you will need to cd into the food-truck-challenge folder, run npm install, and run npm start. It should open in a browser window for you. Or you can view it on Vercel below!

Thanks for reviewing and I am excited to hear back!
